❌ Bad Code:\n```javascript\nfunction sum() { return a+b }\n```\n\n🔍 Issues:\n*   ❌ The function `sum` does not declare or define the variables `a` and `b`. This will likely lead to an error (e.g., `ReferenceError: a is not defined`) when the function is executed.\n*   ❌ The function doesn't accept any arguments, making it inflexible and dependent on variables in its outer scope.\n\n✅ Recommended Fix:\n```javascript\nfunction sum(a, b) { return a + b; }\n```\n\n💡 Improvements:\n\n*   ✔️ The function now accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, making it reusable and self-contained.\n*   ✔️ The function performs the addition of `a` and `b` and returns the result.\n\nFinal Notes:\n\n*   The improved code is more robust and adheres to better coding practices by explicitly declaring its dependencies (arguments) and performing a clear, well-defined task.\n*   Consider adding input validation or type checking if the function needs to handle specific types of inputs.\n
